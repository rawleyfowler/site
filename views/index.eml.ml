    Hi, I'm Rawley. I'm a software developer and self-proclaimed systems administrator
    from Saskatchewan, Canada. I am experienced with a wide variety of technologies, including 
    but not limited to OCaml, Clojure, Scheme, GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, C/C++,
    and Java. I am particularily interested in functional programming and
    programming language theory.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of my personal projects are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">Free Software</a> and can be
    found on <a href="https://git.rawley.xyz">my git server</a> or, on my <a href="https://github.com/rawleyfowler">github</a>. 
    I spend most of my free time working on personal projects,
    writing blog posts, or listening to bluegrass music.
    To top it all off, I am a free software advocate, digital minimalist, and a full time husband.
