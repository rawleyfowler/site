  <h3>Hello!</h3>
  <p>
    My name is Rawley, I'm a Software Developer from central Canada, with 3 years of development experience.
    I write a lot of code everyday. For my job I write Java and TypeScript, and for my personal projects
    I write Raku, Perl and OCaml. Raku is my favorite programming language, OCaml is a close second. Most of my personal
    work is focused on functional programming, distributed systems, and programming language theory. However,
    I'm not opposed to working in projects that reside in other fields (especially using OCaml or Raku!) If you
    have a project that you need help with, don't be scared to reach out!
  </p>
  <p>
    I like to use tools that empower the developer, and provide that old-school 90's hacker feeling. Raku, OCaml
    and Perl provide the best developer experience for me, and I would recommend them to anyone looking to
    broaden (or even start) their knowledge of Computer Science. Teaching has always been one of my interests,
    I try my best to help newcomers find their footing in Computer Science whenever I can. Some of my best Computer Science related
    memories involve teaching functional programming and algebraic effects to OOP developers.

    All of my personal projects are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">Free Software</a> and can be found on
    my <a href="https://github.com/rawleyfowler">Github</a>. I encourage anyone and everyone to contribute!

    Any work/opportunity emails should have an obvious subject like: "Opportunity: I have a cool project called cat-pants come work for me".
