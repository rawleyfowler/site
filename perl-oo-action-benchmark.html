            <h1>Perl OO benchmarking</h1>
            <p>
                I've spent a lot of time working in projects that use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern"><code>Action pattern</code></a> (also called the <code>Command pattern</code>).
                Now, regardless of how i've land on OO vs Functional in the last 5 years, there has always been a question I have yet to answer: "How much does this abstraction cost,
                and more importantly, how much does object instantiation actually cost?" (since the action pattern has you instantiating A LOT of objects)
            </p>
            <p>
                So I set out to benchmark, Perl OO, using the traditional Module OO, <code>Corinna</code>, <code>Moo</code> and <code>Moose</code>. But I thought it may also
                provide some value to compare these findings to other languages, namely ones in the same sort of realm that Perl has lives in: <code>Ruby</code> and <code>Raku (formerly Perl 6)</code>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="theBenchmark">The benchmark</h2>
            <p>
                The benchmark is fairly simple, since the goal here is to test the actual instantiation costs, so the method associated with the implemented action is very simple.
                An <code>Action</code> object has two members, <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>. It's <code>execute</code> method returns a Map/Hash/Dictionary, with the following keys
                <code>{ name => self.name, age => self.age }</code>. Basically just accessing the instantiated objects <code>age</code> and <code>name</code> attributes, and associating them to
                keys of the same name.
            </p>
            <p>
                One-million <code>Action</code> objects will be instantiated in a O(n) loop, and executed, then destroyed all within the same scope. Like so:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
my $name = 'Tim';
my $age  = 12;
for ( 1 .. 1000000 ) {
    my $user = Action->new( name => $name, name => $age )->execute();
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                This will be performed one-hundred times, then, the average of the times taken to do the one-million iterations will be the benchmark result.
                It is also important to note that the initial load-time of the language run-times is included in the calculation, though they are mostly negligble especially
                in the Perl case, and the actual instantiation takes the vast-majority of the time (close to 99% on average).
            </p>
            <p>
                This benchmark was performed on an Intel i7 12700KF, using DDR5 memory.

                This implementation is alright, it's fast, but it doesn't provide any validations, which is what I assume most OO frameworks like <code>Moo</code> and <code>Moose</code> do, especially

            <p>
                Considering my assumptions about other OO libraries I decided to add a few checks to the Module OO implementation,
                using <code>Scalar::Util</code> we can test if <code>age</code> is a number, and also ensure the defined-ness of our
                attributes using the built-in <code>defined</code>.

            <p>
                Corinna is a new OO system added to Perl 5.38 but still marked as experimental. It performs very well compared to the features it provides,
                but it is definitely not something you'll see in the wild too often.
            </p>
            <pre>

            <p>
                I had to disable warnings on this because I wasn't sure what flags I needed to set in the <code>feature</code> or the <code>experimental</code>,
                also the lack of documentation definitely hurt, it took me a while to figure out I had to <code>use feature 'class';</code>. For some reason I thought
                the feature flag was <code>corinna</code> or something.

            <p>
                <code>Moo</code> is a "Minimalist Object Orientation" for Perl. It's what I've used the most, and it performs quite well for all of the
                features it gives you. However, there is definitely a cost, one that a lot of developers ignore. I've done two implementations here, one with
                <code>Type::Tiny</code>, which adds optional type-checking to attributes, and one without. The difference was quite compelling!

            Without <code>Type::Tiny</code>:

                To my shock, <code>Type::Tiny</code> degrades performance by close to 300%. However, the more I looked into <code>Type::Tiny</code>, the more it made sense.
                <code>Type::Tiny</code>, to enforce types uses a lot of complex meta-programming, and ref checks, that add up to a ton of extra operations. Perhaps it would be
                worth using <code>B::Concise</code> or <code>B::Deparse</code> to see how many more operations this actually adds, but thats something for another day.

            <p>
                <code>Moose</code> is a heavyweight, industrial purpose OO framework for Perl, at which <code>Moo</code> derives from. It is big, and heavy, and unfortunately,
                really slow for tasks like this. After starting this benchmark, I thought that the slowness was coming from loading the module between runs, but after timing the average load time,
                the time spent was negligble (31ms at most).
            </p>

              Immutable often means faster in-terms of creation but slower in terms of manipulation, but since this workload spends most of its time creating, and none of its time editing,
              this produced an incredible 10x speed improvement.

                I also did a quick Ruby implementation, since its a "true" Object-Oriented language, I assumed it would have
                a lot of optimizations built-in for this sort of work, and based on its runtime, that seems to be the case.

                Finally, we have Raku, which unfortunately doesn't do too well. To make this a little more competitive,
                I subtracted the run-time of MoarVM from the end-result. Though, I think Raku's implementation is the simplest to
                understand in terms of langauge design, so it gets a +1 from me for that.

            <h5>Code:</h5>
            <pre>
                <code>
class Action {
    has $.name;
    has $.age;

    method execute {
        return %(name => $!name, age => $!age);
    }
}

my $name = 'Tim';
my $age = 12;
for 1..1000000 -> $ {
    my $user = Action.new(name => $name, age => $age).execute();
}

                </code>
            </pre>
            <h5>Time (with MoarVM startup time removed):</h5>
            <pre>
                <code>
RAKU TIME : 801.947ms

            <h2>So what?</h2>
            <p>
                Object instantiation has a cost. A lot of people ignore this, especially when using heavyweight libraries like <code>Moose</code>.
                You can put this into practical terms simply, using basic Perl module OO you effectively double the number of objects of this type you can create and execute a
                method on given any time-frame compared to <code>Moo</code> without types, and twenty-two times more objects versus <code>Moose</code> without types.
                But these abstractions exist for reasons, and they are used for a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>Moo</code> and <code>Moose</code> have their places, especially in web-applications where the number of instantiations is low, and the expensive
                operations happen during side-effects like database operations.
                This also goes without mentioning some of the great features modules like <code>Moo</code> and <code>Moose</code> provide.
                It is valuable to know that if you need something to perform well, <code>Moo</code> and <code>Moose</code>
                may incur overhead you hadn't previously considered. This is compounded when enforcing types.
                For hot-code that will be hit repeatedly within a short amount of time, this can drastically effect performance, think of things like a landing page, or a search-bar API.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>Corinna</code>, is a very nice prospect, it offers a lot of great things from <code>Moo</code> and <code>Moose</code> but seems to
                exalt far less of a performance penalty. It will definitely be on my radar in the future, especially when the documentation improves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another approach is to simply use functions, which of course will perform the best. But, it's hard to argue to do this unless performance is the number one goal,
                especially on codebases that follow this pattern.
