            <h1>How to Properly Use Global Variables</h1>
            <p>
                Global variables, and global state in general have been under fire for as long as I can remember.
                The argument is, you couple, and introduce unpredictability through managing global variables
                since "anyone can update them". This makes sense in a cosmological world, filled with people
                who WANT to write bad code. It's not the global variables that make code bad, it's how they're used.
                We've spent many years inventing abstraction after abstraction, that could just be boiled down to global variables,
                and global constants. In the end, applications will always have global state, why make it so dang difficult?
            </p>
            <h2>Simplicity, and avoiding traps</h2>
            <p>
                Globals are simple, so simple, that even the thought of using them might turn people off. It's hard to accept
                that the simplest answer is always the best one, but it almost always is. 99% of the code I run into, is complex for the sake of "reusability", "readability", or
                "scalability", but in the end none of these come to pass. You'll see interfaces, and abstract classes defined for single implementations,
                horribly generic code written in obscure places, and a mess of a file structure with hundreds of files. Do you really need a generic interface for
                each of your database tables, or what about a "service" for each "domain"? In reality, the most readable, resuable, and scalable code, is the code that
                compiles well, and avoids mentally expensive abstraction. If I have to walk through the inheritence graph to figure out what something is doing, it's already neither
                scalable, or readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll often see global variables hidden behind some "global context" like abstraction. This is down right deplorable, instead, hide your globals behind the simplest
                abstraction on the market, the function. <code>GetDatabaseHandler()</code> is much simpler to reason about than <code>GlobalContextHolder.getSingleton().getContext("database")</code>.
                These abstractions also, are prone to error, for instance if you use a hash-table to lookup values with a string key, what happens if I miss type the string? The compiler
                won't catch that for you, and you'd be adding a lot of extra instructions just to access some state somewhere (which at its fastest is a pointer dereference). Another common way to do this,
                is to pass a class object, <code>.class</code> in Java. However, this is even worse. Typically, a language will use reflection which or runtime type checks which can be extraordinarily slow.
                To compound this, you also have no gurantees on the existence of the values, for instance, if you want a <code>DatabaseHandler</code>, and you make the request for it, you have no idea
                if that is actually the right name or class until runtime. Contrast that with a function that will be picked up by your LSP or produce a compile-time error message.
                Global contexts, and contexts in general are a huge mess of slow, hard to optimize code, you should avoid them at all costs.
            </p>
            <h2>What to do instead</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, global state should exist one layer under a function. There is absolutely nothing wrong with running a <code>database.InitializeDatabase()</code> function, to
                initialize your globals at startup, or having some sort of lazy-init built into your global accessor function. Keeping things simple is how you keep them readable, and scalable.
                What's funny, is that's pretty much it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing I recommend is not accessing your globals inside of your functions, instead, pass them as arguments. This is just good-practice in general, your functions should
                do their best to be as pure as possible. This also makes your code truly re-usable and adaptable, since you may have multiple different global variables with the same types.
                This also makes your code easy to test, since it's not relying on any outside values existing or not.
            </p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>
                Let's compare some code. In the first example, we'll do the traditional <code>GlobalContextHolder</code> OOP style,
                where we literally do our best to make it look like we're not working on global variables. In the second example, we allow our globals to exist,
                but instead of accessing them in a foolish way, we accept them as parameters.
            </p>
            <p>Example 1:</p>
            <pre>
                <code lang="java">
public void saveUser(User u) {
    // Where did this guy come from? Idk, it's probably defined in some XML file somewhere :)
    DatabaseHandler dbh = GlobalContextHolder.getContext("database");
    dbh.table("users").save(u);
}

// Main.java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    User user = new User("Bob", 23);
    saveUser(user);
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Example 2:</p>
            <pre>
                <code lang="java">
// Database.java
private static DatabaseHandler DBH;

public static DatabaseHandler getDatabase() {
    if (DBH == null) {
        DBH = DatabaseHandler.newConnection("mysql://foo@bar:foo.com:3306");
    }

    return DBH;
}

// Main.java
public static void saveUser(User u, DatabaseHandler dbh) {
    dbh.table("users").save(u);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Database.initialize();
    User user = new User("Bob", 23);
    saveUser(user, Database.get());
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
              Overall, this drastically reduces the mental overhead of the system, allowing for simple unit-testing (if you want), and
              a simplistic approach to scaling, since you don't have to worry about costly abstractions that don't actually simplify anything.
