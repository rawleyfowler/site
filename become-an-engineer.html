                This is the way to becoming a truly great software engineer. I've read all of these books, and I can say that they all manifest within
                me a strong sense of confidence, and the ability to adapt to any situation that might come my way in computer science.

                You may be reading this list, thinking... what about Java or JavaScript??? Now, I don't think these languages are bad per-se, but I do think
                they have the ability to destroy your life. Once you've used Java or JavaScript, there is a good chance you will become closed off from
                the rest of the computing world, falling into a world of patterns and objects. You may also find that languages like these have the adverse
                effect of having incredibly low skill-ceilings, which compounds the idea of you becoming stuck. A low ceiling, and a low floor, is a prison, not
                a tool to conjure the spirits of the computer.
