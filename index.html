    <p>
      Hi, I'm Rawley, a Software Engineer from rural Saskatchewan, Canada.
      I specialize in <a href="https://perl.org">Perl</a>, <a href="https://ocaml.org">OCaml</a>, and <a href="https://go.dev">Go</a> development, tackling all areas
      of the software life cycle. Most recently I have been developing microservices using Java, SpringBoot, and PostgreSQL. I'm passionate about software performance,
      functional programming, and type-systems. If you have a position that you think I'd like (especially focusing on Perl, OCaml, or Go), please feel free to <a href="mailto:rawleyfowler@proton.me">email</a> me.
      Outside of my professional work, I spend a lot of time <a href="https://github.com/rawleyfowler">contributing</a> to open-source projects. You may or may not have used some of them :)
    </p>
