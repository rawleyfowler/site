=================================================
My personal website and blog, written using HTML, CSS, OCaml, and Raku.
My blog is a hodge-podge of technology, mathematics, philosophy, and DIY.
This site is basically a playground for me to do goofy stuff, you will most likely never be able to run this
without jumping through a crap ton of hoops.
